# Deep-Neural-Network

In this coding assignment, you need to implement the deep neural network by any deep learning framework, e.g., Pytorch, TensorFlow, or Keras, then train the DNN model by the Cifar-10 dataset and try to beat the baseline performance.

[Sample code and Dataset](https://github.com/NCTU-VRDL/CS_AT0828/tree/main/HW5)

## Introduction

This repository use [CaiT](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models/blob/master/timm/models/cait.py) model and SGD optimizer.

## Training

To train the model, you need modify the 'TRAIN' to True of HW5.py, and then run this command:

```train
python HW5.py
```

## Testing

Need your best.pt (model weights), and just run this command:

```train
python HW5.py
```
